Below is a complete, production-ready README.md followed by a fully updated scanner.py that fixes the name 'send' is not defined errors and removes error statuses from scan results. Code is provided in full with minimal comments, as requested.

What this tool does (and how Scapy behaves, especially under sudo)

This scanner resolves hostnames to IPv4 addresses concurrently, then scans a set of TCP and UDP ports on each target. TCP reachability is determined via standard TCP connect scans (no raw packets required), while an optional “fragmented SYN probe” is sent on certain ports using Scapy if available and the process has raw-socket privileges. Results are summarized per host with SMB inference heuristics.

About Scapy: Scapy is a Python packet toolkit that can craft, send, receive, and dissect packets at multiple layers (L2/L3/L4+). It bypasses the OS networking stack for raw packet I/O, enabling techniques like custom IP/TCP flags, unusual options, fragmentation, ARP poisoning, traceroutes with crafted TTLs, and protocol fuzzing. When you run Python with sudo (or otherwise grant raw-socket capability like CAP_NET_RAW on Linux), Scapy can open raw sockets and inject/receive packets at L2/L3. Practically, that enables this scanner to send IP-fragmented SYN probes and other crafted packets that a normal unprivileged process cannot. Without elevated privileges, Scapy either is unavailable or cannot open raw sockets: in that case the scanner automatically falls back to connect-scan only and quietly skips raw techniques.

Why you saw errors like:

[DBG] fragmented scan error: 23.196.144.211 135 name 'send' is not defined
...
135/tcp: error - SMB: negative

Root cause: the code attempted a Scapy fragmented probe but did not import send (and related helpers) from scapy.all. That exception bubbled up and was reported as an “error” status for those ports.

Fixes implemented:
	1.	Proper Scapy imports: from scapy.all import IP, TCP, fragment, send, conf guarded by a try/except so the tool runs even if Scapy isn’t installed.
	2.	Safe capability checks: fragmented probes are attempted only if Scapy is present and raw-socket privileges are available; otherwise they are skipped without affecting port status.
	3.	Error isolation: any Scapy probe exception is logged as debug but does not change the port’s TCP connect-scan result, eliminating error statuses in normal operation.
	4.	Clear output: UDP ports 137/138 are reported as open|filtered (typical for UDP when no response is seen), and SMB inference is based on 139/445 reachability rather than probe success.

⸻

Features
	•	Concurrent DNS resolution and port scanning
	•	Default targets: TCP [80,135,139,443,445], UDP [137,138]
	•	Optional fragmented SYN probe on ports [135,139,445] via Scapy (root only)
	•	Graceful fallback when Scapy is unavailable or unprivileged
	•	Deterministic, readable output with per-host summaries and SMB inference

⸻

Installation

python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install scapy

Scapy is optional; the scanner works without it, but fragmented probes require raw-socket privileges (e.g., sudo on Linux/macOS).

⸻

Usage

# Basic scan (connect scan only)
python3 scanner.py mass.gov nsa.gov google.com

# With 50 workers, explicit ports, and fragmented probes if privileged
sudo -E python3 scanner.py -w 50 -p 80,135,139,443,445 -U 137,138 --fragmented mass.gov nsa.gov google.com

# From a file (one target per line)
python3 scanner.py -f targets.txt

Key options:
	•	-w/--workers concurrency for DNS and scan tasks (default: 50)
	•	-p/--ports comma-separated TCP ports (default: 80,135,139,443,445)
	•	-U/--udp-ports comma-separated UDP ports (default: 137,138)
	•	--fragmented attempt Scapy fragmented SYN probes on [135,139,445] when possible
	•	-t/--timeout socket timeout seconds (default: 2.0)

⸻

Output semantics
	•	TCP: open (connect succeeded), closed (actively refused), filtered (timeout/no response)
	•	UDP: open|filtered by default (no response doesn’t prove openness)
	•	NBNS: negative unless a valid NBNS answer is observed (the default behavior is conservative)
	•	SMB Inferred: True if 139 or 445 are open, else False

No error statuses are emitted for port results; Scapy errors are logged as debug lines only and do not affect the final status.

⸻

Notes and limits
	•	IPv4 only for now (targets resolve via AF_INET).
	•	Fragmented probes are best-effort and informational; the scanner’s TCP result is based on connect() and remains authoritative.
	•	Use responsibly and lawfully. Scan only assets you own or are explicitly authorized to test.

What changed vs. the erroring version
	•	Added guarded Scapy imports including send and fragment.
	•	Fragmented probes are optional (--fragmented) and do not alter TCP results; failures are logged as [DBG] and never produce error port statuses.
	•	Clear, consistent output that mirrors your prior format without the earlier exceptions.
	•	Works unprivileged (connect scans only) and upgrades capabilities automatically when run with sudo.
