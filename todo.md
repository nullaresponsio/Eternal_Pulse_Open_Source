# TO DO 


We are going to enhance the scanner with the following features:
 1. **Evasion Techniques**: We will add more evasion techniques and improve existing ones.
    - Add more techniques: 
        * Traffic fragmentation (already present)
        * Protocol tunneling (already present)
        * Traffic morphing (already present)
        * Packet padding (already present)
        * Source IP spoofing (already present)
        * Add: 
            - Random packet size variation
            - Random TTL variation
            - DNS tunneling simulation
            - HTTP tunneling simulation
            - Time-to-live (TTL) manipulation
            - IP ID randomization
            - TCP sequence number randomization
 2. **Backdoor Installation**: 
    - We'll expand the backdoor simulation to include multiple methods (e.g., registry persistence, scheduled tasks, service installation) and simulate communication with C2.
 3. **Stealth and Randomization**:
    - We already have jitter and random delays. We'll add:
        * Randomize the order of port scanning per target
        * Randomize the order of target scanning
        * Randomize the source port for each scan
 4. **Protocol Fuzzing with Genetic Algorithms**:
    - We'll create a new module for genetic algorithm-based fuzzing. This will require:
        * A fitness function to evaluate responses (e.g., crashes, errors, unexpected behavior)
        * Mutation and crossover operations for payloads
        * A population of payloads that evolves over generations
 5. **Service Fingerprinting**:
    - We'll enhance the service fingerprinting to include:
        * SMB version detection
        * RDP version detection
        * SSH version detection
        * HTTP server and application detection
        * DNS server version detection
 6. **Reporting**:
    - We'll enhance the reporting to include more details, especially on vulnerabilities and services.
 7. **Modular Design**:
    - We'll break the scanner into separate modules:
        * `evasion.py` for evasion techniques
        * `fingerprint.py` for service fingerprinting
        * `fuzzer.py` for the genetic fuzzer
        * `vulnerabilities.py` for vulnerability checks
        * `backdoor.py` for backdoor installation and C2 simulation
        * `reporting.py` for reporting
 8. **Error Handling**:
    - We'll add more comprehensive error handling and logging throughout.
 9. **Command and Control (C2) Simulation**:
    - We'll simulate C2 communication for installed backdoors. This includes:
        * Beaconing with jitter
        * Command execution simulation
        * Data exfiltration simulation
