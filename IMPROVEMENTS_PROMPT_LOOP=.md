implement as many upgrades as possible into scanner.py and provide full upgraded file; ensure that garbage code isn't running and make sure scanner.py prints to debug what it's doing during the run at least once every 10 seconds with actual details of what it's doing: 


Explain in detail which potential undiscovered vulnerabilities may exist in the smb v2 and v3 protocols and which intelligent use and improvements to this script of overflowing or corrupting target servers and systems somehow an intelligent capabilities developer may pursue next to discover ways to land proprietary zero days of remote execution hence unknown to smb users and developers across all types of servers as well as end devices. Think carefully which intelligent paths of thought previous known smb remote executions used and were discovered then think carefully again about the fundamental truths of how smb was build and its source code. Finally intelligently deduce the next best thought processes of how to best use overflow and corruption techniques to attack targets and gain remote execution:
